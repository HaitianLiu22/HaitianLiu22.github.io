# About me

I am a second-year M.S. student at [School of Software Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://se.xjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Li Zhu](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/zhuli). Previously, I received my B.S. degree from [College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University](http://csee.hnu.edu.cn/) in 2022.

# Research interests

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
